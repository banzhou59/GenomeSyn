Text::CSV_XS provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of
comma-separated values.  An instance of the Text::CSV_XS class can combine
fields into a \s-1CSV\s0 string and parse a \s-1CSV\s0 string into fields.
.PP
The module accepts either strings or files as input and can utilize any
user-specified characters as delimiters, separators, and escapes so it is
perhaps better called \s-1ASV\s0 (anything separated values) rather than just \s-1CSV\s0.
.SS "Embedded newlines"
.IX Subsection "Embedded newlines"
\&\fBImportant Note\fR: The default behavior is to only accept \s-1ASCII\s0 characters.
This means that fields can not contain newlines. If your data contains
newlines embedded in fields, or characters above 0x7e (tilde), or binary
data, you \fB\f(BImust\fB\fR set \f(CW\*(C`binary => 1\*(C'\fR in the call to \*(L"new\*(R". To
cover the widest range of parsing options, you will always want to set
binary.
.PP
But you still have the problem that you have to pass a correct line to the
\&\*(L"parse\*(R" method, which is more complicated from the usual point of usage:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& my $csv = Text::CSV_XS\->new ({ binary => 1, eol => $/ });
\& while (<>) {           #  WRONG!
\&     $csv\->parse ($_);
\&     my @fields = $csv\->fields ();
.Ve
.PP
will break, as the while might read broken lines, as that does not care
about the quoting. If you need to support embedded newlines, the way to go
is either
.PP
.Vb 3
\& my $csv = Text::CSV_XS\->new ({ binary => 1, eol => $/ });
\& while (my $row = $csv\->getline (*ARGV)) {
\&     my @fields = @$row;
.Ve
.PP
or, more safely in perl 5.6 and up
.PP
.Vb 4
\& my $csv = Text::CSV_XS\->new ({ binary => 1, eol => $/ });
\& open my $io, "<", $file or die "$file: $!";

.SS "Unicode"
.IX Subsection "Unicode"
On parsing (both for \*(L"getline\*(R" and \*(L"parse\*(R"), if the source is marked
being \s-1UTF8\s0, then all fields that are marked binary will also be be
marked \s-1UTF8\s0.
.PP
For complete control over encoding, please use Text::CSV::Encoded:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& use Text::CSV::Encoded;
\& my $csv = Text::CSV::Encoded\->new ({
\&     encoding_in  => "iso\-8859\-1", # the encoding comes into   Perl
\&     encoding_out => "cp1252",     # the encoding comes out of Perl
\&     });
\&
\& $csv = Text::CSV::Encoded\->new ({ encoding  => "utf8" });
\& # combine () and print () accept *literally* utf8 encoded data
\& # parse () and getline () return *literally* utf8 encoded data
\&
\& $csv = Text::CSV::Encoded\->new ({ encoding  => undef }); # default
\& # combine () and print () accept UTF8 marked data
\& # parse () and getline () return UTF8 marked data
.Ve
.PP
On combining (\*(L"print\*(R" and \*(L"combine\*(R"), if any of the combining fields
was marked \s-1UTF8\s0, the resulting string will be marked \s-1UTF8\s0. Note however
that all fields \fIbefore\fR the first field that was marked \s-1UTF8\s0 and
contained 8\-bit characters that were not upgraded to \s-1UTF8\s0, these will be
bytes in the resulting string too, causing errors. If you pass data of
different encoding, or you don't know if there is different encoding, force
it to be upgraded before you pass them on:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $csv\->print ($fh, [ map { utf8::upgrade (my $x = $_); $x } @data ]);

.SH "SPECIFICATION"
.IX Header "SPECIFICATION"
While no formal specification for \s-1CSV\s0 exists, \s-1RFC\s0 4180 1) describes a
common format and establishes \*(L"text/csv\*(R" as the \s-1MIME\s0 type registered with
the \s-1IANA\s0.
.PP
Many informal documents exist that describe the \s-1CSV\s0 format. How To: The
Comma Separated Value (\s-1CSV\s0) File Format 2) provides an overview of the \s-1CSV\s0
format in the most widely used applications and explains how it can best be
used and supported.
.PP
.Vb 2
\& 1) http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180
\& 2) http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm
.Ve
.PP
The basic rules are as follows:
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CSV\s0\fR is a delimited data format that has fields/columns separated by the
comma character and records/rows separated by newlines. Fields that contain
a special character (comma, newline, or double quote), must be enclosed in
double quotes.  However, if a line contains a single entry which is the
empty string, it may be enclosed in double quotes. If a field's value
contains a double quote character it is escaped by placing another double
quote character next to it. The \s-1CSV\s0 file format does not require a specific
character encoding, byte order, or line terminator format.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Each record is one line terminated by a line feed (ASCII/LF=0x0A) or a
carriage return and line feed pair (ASCII/CRLF=0x0D 0x0A), however,
line-breaks can be embedded.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fields are separated by commas.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Allowable characters within a \s-1CSV\s0 field include 0x09 (tab) and the
inclusive range of 0x20 (space) through 0x7E (tilde). In binary mode all
characters are accepted, at least in quoted fields.
.IP "\(bu" 2
A field within \s-1CSV\s0 must be surrounded by double-quotes to contain a the
separator character (comma).
.PP
Though this is the most clear and restrictive definition, Text::CSV_XS is
way more liberal than this, and allows extension:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Line termination by a single carriage return is accepted by default
.IP "\(bu" 2
The separation\-, escape\-, and escape\- characters can be any \s-1ASCII\s0 character
in the range from 0x20 (space) to 0x7E (tilde). Characters outside this
range may or may not work as expected. Multibyte characters, like U+060c
(\s-1ARABIC\s0 \s-1COMMA\s0), U+FF0C (\s-1FULLWIDTH\s0 \s-1COMMA\s0), U+241B (\s-1SYMBOL\s0 \s-1FOR\s0 \s-1ESCAPE\s0),
U+2424 (\s-1SYMBOL\s0 \s-1FOR\s0 \s-1NEWLINE\s0), U+FF02 (\s-1FULLWIDTH\s0 \s-1QUOTATION\s0 \s-1MARK\s0), and U+201C
(\s-1LEFT\s0 \s-1DOUBLE\s0 \s-1QUOTATION\s0 \s-1MARK\s0) (to give some examples of what might look
promising) are therefor not allowed.
.Sp
If you use perl\-5.8.2 or higher, these three attributes are utf8\-decoded,
to increase the likelihood of success. This way U+00FE will be allowed as a
quote character.
.IP "\(bu" 2
A field within \s-1CSV\s0 must be surrounded by double-quotes to contain an
embedded double-quote, represented by a pair of consecutive double-quotes.
In binary mode you may additionally use the sequence \f(CW\*(C`"0\*(C'\fR for
representation of a \s-1NULL\s0 byte.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Several violations of the above specification may be allowed by passing
options to the object creator.

.PP
Currently the following attributes are available:
.IP "eol" 4
.IX Xref "eol"
.IX Item "eol"
An end-of-line string to add to rows. \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is replaced with an empty
string. The default is \f(CW\*(C`$\e\*(C'\fR. Common values for \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR are \f(CW"\e012"\fR (Line
Feed) or \f(CW"\e015\e012"\fR (Carriage Return, Line Feed).  Cannot be longer than
7 (\s-1ASCII\s0) characters.
.Sp
If both \f(CW$/\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR equal \f(CW"\e015"\fR, parsing lines that end on only a
Carriage Return without Line Feed, will be \*(L"parse\*(R"d correct. Line endings,
whether in \f(CW$/\fR or \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR, other than \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, \f(CW"\en"\fR, \f(CW"\er\en"\fR, or
\&\f(CW"\er"\fR are not (yet) supported for parsing.
.IP "sep_char" 4
.IX Xref "sep_char"
.IX Item "sep_char"
The char used for separating fields, by default a comma. (\f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR).  Limited
to a single-byte character, usually in the range from 0x20 (space) to 0x7e
(tilde).
.Sp
The separation character can not be equal to the quote character.  The
separation character can not be equal to the escape character.
.Sp
See also \*(L"\s-1CAVEATS\s0\*(R"
.IP "allow_whitespace" 4
.IX Xref "allow_whitespace"
.IX Item "allow_whitespace"
When this option is set to true, whitespace (\s-1TAB\s0's and \s-1SPACE\s0's) surrounding
the separation character is removed when parsing. If either \s-1TAB\s0 or \s-1SPACE\s0 is
one of the three major characters \f(CW\*(C`sep_char\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR it will not be considered whitespace.
.Sp
So lines like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& 1 , "foo" , bar , 3 , zapp
.Ve
.Sp
are now correctly parsed, even though it violates the \s-1CSV\s0 specs.
.Sp
Note that \fBall\fR whitespace is stripped from start and end of each field.
That would make it more a \fIfeature\fR than a way to be able to parse bad \s-1CSV\s0
lines, as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& 1,   2.0,  3,   ape  , monkey
.Ve
.Sp
will now be parsed as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& ("1", "2.0", "3", "ape", "monkey")
.Ve
.Sp
even if the original line was perfectly sane \s-1CSV\s0.
.IP "blank_is_undef" 4
.IX Xref "blank_is_undef"
.IX Item "blank_is_undef"
Under normal circumstances, \s-1CSV\s0 data makes no distinction between quoted\-
and unquoted empty fields. They both end up in an empty string field once
read, so
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& 1,"",," ",2
.Ve
.Sp
is read as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& ("1", "", "", " ", "2")
.Ve
.Sp
When \fIwriting\fR \s-1CSV\s0 files with \f(CW\*(C`always_quote\*(C'\fR set, the unquoted empty
field is the result of an undefined value. To make it possible to also make
this distinction when reading \s-1CSV\s0 data, the \f(CW\*(C`blank_is_undef\*(C'\fR option will
cause unquoted empty fields to be set to undef, causing the above to be
parsed as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& ("1", "", undef, " ", "2")
.Ve
.IP "empty_is_undef" 4
.IX Xref "empty_is_undef"
.IX Item "empty_is_undef"
Going one step further than \f(CW\*(C`blank_is_undef\*(C'\fR, this attribute converts all
empty fields to undef, so
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& 1,"",," ",2
.Ve
.Sp
is read as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& (1, undef, undef, " ", 2)
.Ve
.Sp
Note that this only effects fields that are \fIreally\fR empty, not fields
that are empty after stripping allowed whitespace. \s-1YMMV\s0.
.IP "quote_char" 4
.IX Xref "quote_char"
.IX Item "quote_char"
The char used for quoting fields containing blanks, by default the double
quote character (\f(CW\*(C`"\*(C'\fR). A value of undef suppresses quote chars. (For
simple cases only).  Limited to a single-byte character, usually in the
range from 0x20 (space) to 0x7e (tilde).
.Sp
The quote character can not be equal to the separation character.
.IP "allow_loose_quotes" 4
.IX Xref "allow_loose_quotes"
.IX Item "allow_loose_quotes"
By default, parsing fields that have \f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR characters inside an
unquoted field, like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& 1,foo "bar" baz,42
.Ve
.Sp
would result in a parse error. Though it is still bad practice to allow
this format, we cannot help there are some vendors that make their
applications spit out lines styled like this.
.Sp
In case there is \fBreally\fR bad \s-1CSV\s0 data, like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& 1,"foo "bar" baz",42
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& 1,""foo bar baz"",42
.Ve
.Sp
there is a way to get that parsed, and leave the quotes inside the quoted
field as-is. This can be achieved by setting \f(CW\*(C`allow_loose_quotes\*(C'\fR \fB\s-1AND\s0\fR
making sure that the \f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR is \fInot\fR equal to \f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR.
.IP "escape_char" 4
.IX Xref "escape_char"
.IX Item "escape_char"
The character used for escaping certain characters inside quoted fields.
Limited to a single-byte character, usually in the range from 0x20 (space)
to 0x7e (tilde).
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR defaults to being the literal double-quote mark (\f(CW\*(C`"\*(C'\fR)
in other words, the same as the default \f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR. This means that
doubling the quote mark in a field escapes it:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& "foo","bar","Escape ""quote mark"" with two ""quote marks""","baz"
.Ve
.Sp
If you change the default quote_char without changing the default
escape_char, the escape_char will still be the quote mark.  If instead you
want to escape the quote_char by doubling it, you will need to change the
escape_char to be the same as what you changed the quote_char to.
.Sp
The escape character can not be equal to the separation character.
.IP "allow_loose_escapes" 4
.IX Xref "allow_loose_escapes"
.IX Item "allow_loose_escapes"
By default, parsing fields that have \f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR characters that escape
characters that do not need to be escaped, like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& my $csv = Text::CSV_XS\->new ({ escape_char => "\e\e" });
\& $csv\->parse (qq{1,"my bar\e\*(Aqs",baz,42});
.Ve
.Sp
would result in a parse error. Though it is still bad practice to allow
this format, this option enables you to treat all escape character
sequences equal.
.IP "allow_unquoted_escape" 4
.IX Xref "allow_unquoted_escape"
.IX Item "allow_unquoted_escape"
There is a backward compatibility issue in that the escape character, when
differing from the quotation character, cannot be on the first position of
a field. e.g. with \f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR equal to the default \f(CW\*(C`"\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR set to \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR, this would be illegal:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& 1,\e0,2
.Ve
.Sp
To overcome issues with backward compatibility, you can allow this by
setting this attribute to 1.
.IP "binary" 4
.IX Xref "binary"
.IX Item "binary"
If this attribute is \s-1TRUE\s0, you may use binary characters in quoted fields,
including line feeds, carriage returns and \s-1NULL\s0 bytes. (The latter must be
escaped as \f(CW\*(C`"0\*(C'\fR.) By default this feature is off.
.Sp
If a string is marked \s-1UTF8\s0, binary will be turned on automatically when
binary characters other than \s-1CR\s0 or \s-1NL\s0 are encountered. Note that a simple
string like \f(CW"\ex{00a0}"\fR might still be binary, but not marked \s-1UTF8\s0, so
setting \f(CW\*(C`{ binary =\*(C'\fR 1 }> is still a wise option.
.IP "types" 4
.IX Xref "types"
.IX Item "types"
A set of column types; this attribute is immediately passed to the
\&\*(L"types\*(R" method. You must not set this attribute otherwise, except for
using the \*(L"types\*(R" method.
.IP "always_quote" 4
.IX Xref "always_quote"
.IX Item "always_quote"
By default the generated fields are quoted only, if they need to, for
example, if they contain the separator. If you set this attribute to a \s-1TRUE\s0
value, then all defined fields will be quoted. This is typically easier to
handle in external applications. (Poor creatures who are not using
Text::CSV_XS. :\-)
.IP "quote_space" 4
.IX Xref "quote_space"
.IX Item "quote_space"
By default, a space in a field would trigger quotation. As no rule exists
this to be forced in \s-1CSV\s0, nor any for the opposite, the default is true for
safety. You can exclude the space from this trigger by setting this
attribute to 0.
.IP "quote_null" 4
.IX Xref "quote_null"
.IX Item "quote_null"
By default, a \s-1NULL\s0 byte in a field would be escaped. This attribute enables
you to treat the \s-1NULL\s0 byte as a simple binary character in binary mode (the
\&\f(CW\*(C`{ binary => 1 }\*(C'\fR is set). The default is true.  You can prevent \s-1NULL\s0
escapes by setting this attribute to 0.
.IP "quote_binary" 4
.IX Xref "quote_binary"
.IX Item "quote_binary"
By default,  all \*(L"unsafe\*(R" bytes inside a string cause the combined field to
be quoted. By setting this attribute to 0, you can disable that trigger for
bytes >= 0x7f.
.IP "keep_meta_info" 4
.IX Xref "keep_meta_info"
.IX Item "keep_meta_info"
By default, the parsing of input lines is as simple and fast as possible.
However, some parsing information \- like quotation of the original field \-
is lost in that process. Set this flag to true to be able to retrieve that
information after parsing with the methods \*(L"meta_info\*(R", \*(L"is_quoted\*(R",
and \*(L"is_binary\*(R" described below.  Default is false.
.IP "verbatim" 4
.IX Xref "verbatim"
.IX Item "verbatim"
This is a quite controversial attribute to set, but it makes hard things
possible.
.Sp
The basic thought behind this is to tell the parser that the normally
special characters newline (\s-1NL\s0) and Carriage Return (\s-1CR\s0) will not be
special when this flag is set, and be dealt with as being ordinary binary
characters. This will ease working with data with embedded newlines.
.Sp
When \f(CW\*(C`verbatim\*(C'\fR is used with \*(L"getline\*(R", \*(L"getline\*(R" auto-chomp's every
line.
.Sp
Imagine a file format like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& M^^Hans^Janssen^Klas 2\en2A^Ja^11\-06\-2007#\er\en
.Ve
.Sp
where, the line ending is a very specific \*(L"#\er\en\*(R", and the sep_char is a ^
(caret). None of the fields is quoted, but embedded binary data is likely
to be present. With the specific line ending, that should not be too hard
to detect.
.Sp
By default, Text::CSV_XS' parse function however is instructed to only know
about \*(L"\en\*(R" and \*(L"\er\*(R" to be legal line endings, and so has to deal with the
embedded newline as a real end-of-line, so it can scan the next line if
binary is true, and the newline is inside a quoted field.  With this
attribute however, we can tell parse () to parse the line as if \en is just
nothing more than a binary character.
.Sp
For parse () this means that the parser has no idea about line ending
anymore, and getline () chomps line endings on reading.
.IP "auto_diag" 4
.IX Xref "auto_diag"
.IX Item "auto_diag"
Set to true will cause \*(L"error_diag\*(R" to be automatically be called in void
context upon errors.
.Sp
In case of error \f(CW\*(C`2012 \- EOF\*(C'\fR, this call will be void.
.Sp
If set to a value greater than 1, it will die on errors instead of warn.
.Sp
Future extensions to this feature will include more reliable auto-detection
of the \f(CW\*(C`autodie\*(C'\fR module being enabled, which will raise the value of
\&\f(CW\*(C`auto_diag\*(C'\fR with \f(CW1\fR on the moment the error is detected.

\&\f(CW\*(C`Text::CSV_XS\*(C'\fR is not designed to detect the characters used for field

The import/export from Microsoft Excel is a \fIrisky task\fR, according to the
documentation in \f(CW\*(C`Text::CSV::Separator\*(C'\fR. Microsoft uses the system's
default list separator defined in the regional settings, which happens to
be a semicolon for Dutch, German and Spanish (and probably some others as
well).  For the English locale, the default is a comma. In Windows however,
the user is free to choose a predefined locale, and then change every
individual setting in it, so checking the locale is no solution.

.PP
If an error occurred, \f(CW\*(C`$csv\-\*(C'\fRerror_diag> can be used to get more
information on the cause of the failure. Note that for speed reasons, the
internal value is never cleared on success, so using the value returned by
\&\*(L"error_diag\*(R" in normal cases \- when no error occurred \- may cause
unexpected results.
.PP
If the constructor failed, the cause can be found using \*(L"error_diag\*(R" as a
class method, like \f(CW\*(C`Text::CSV_XS\-\*(C'\fRerror_diag>.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`$csv\-\*(C'\fRerror_diag> is automatically called upon error when the contractor
was called with \f(CW\*(C`auto_diag\*(C'\fR set to 1 or 2, or when \f(CW\*(C`autodie\*(C'\fR is in effect.

Currently errors as described below are available. I have tried to make the

And below should be the complete list of error codes that can be returned:
.IP "\(bu" 2
1001 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- sep_char is equal to quote_char or escape_char\*(R"
.IX Xref "1001"
.Sp
The separation character cannot be equal to either the quotation character

equal to \s-1SPACE\s0 or \s-1TAB\s0 is too ambiguous to allow.
.IP "\(bu" 2
1003 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- \er or \en in main attr not allowed\*(R"

Using default \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR characters in either \f(CW\*(C`sep_char\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR is not allowed.

.IX Xref "2010"

When \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR has been set to something specific, other than the default,
like \f(CW"\er\et\en"\fR, and the \f(CW"\er"\fR is following the \fBsecond\fR (closing)
\&\f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR, where the characters following the \f(CW"\er"\fR do not make up
the \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR sequence, this is an error.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2011 \*(L"\s-1ECR\s0 \- Characters after end of quoted field\*(R"
.IX Xref "2011"
.Sp
Sequences like \f(CW\*(C`1,foo,"bar"baz,2\*(C'\fR are not allowed. \f(CW"bar"\fR is a quoted
field, and after the closing quote, there should be either a new-line
sequence or a separation character.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2012 \*(L"\s-1EOF\s0 \- End of data in parsing input stream\*(R"
.IX Xref "2012"

Self-explaining. End-of-file while inside parsing a stream. Can only happen
when reading from streams with \*(L"getline\*(R", as using \*(L"parse\*(R" is done on
strings that are not required to have a trailing \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR.

.IP "\(bu" 2
2023 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- \s-1QUO\s0 character not allowed\*(R"

Sequences like \f(CW\*(C`"foo "bar" baz",quux\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`2023,",2008\-04\-05,"Foo, Bar",\en\*(C'\fR

.IP "\(bu" 2
2025 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- Loose unescaped escape\*(R"

.IP "\(bu" 2
2026 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- Binary character inside quoted field, binary off\*(R"
.IX Xref "2026"
.Sp
Binary characters are not allowed by default. Exceptions are fields that
contain valid \s-1UTF\-8\s0, that will automatically be upgraded is the content is
valid \s-1UTF\-8\s0. Pass the \f(CW\*(C`binary\*(C'\fR attribute with a true value to accept
binary characters.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2027 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- Quoted field not terminated\*(R"
.IX Xref "2027"

When parsing a field that started with a quotation character, the field is
expected to be closed with a quotation character. When the parsed line is
exhausted before the quote is found, that field is not terminated.
