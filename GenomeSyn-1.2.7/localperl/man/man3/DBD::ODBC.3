.SS "Important note about the tests"
.IX Subsection "Important note about the tests"
Please note that some tests may fail or report they are unsupported on
this platform.  Notably Oracle's \s-1ODBC\s0 driver will fail the \*(L"advanced\*(R"
binding tests in t/08bind2.t.  These tests run perfectly under \s-1SQL\s0
Server 2000. This is normal and expected.  Until Oracle fixes their
drivers to do the right thing from an \s-1ODBC\s0 perspective, it's going to
be tough to fix the issue.  The workaround for Oracle is to bind date
types with \s-1SQL_TIMESTAMP\s0.  Also note that some tests may be skipped,
such as t/09multi.t, if your driver doesn't seem to support returning
multiple result sets.  This is normal.
.SS "Version Control"
.IX Subsection "Version Control"
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 source code is under version control at svn.perl.org.  If
you would like to use the \*(L"bleeding\*(R" edge version, you can get the
latest from svn.perl.org via Subversion version control.  Note there
is no guarantee that this version is any different than what you get
from the tarball from \s-1CPAN\s0, but it might be :)
.PP
You may read about Subversion at <http://subversion.tigris.org>
.PP
You can get a subversion client from there and check dbd-odbc out via:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   svn checkout http://svn.perl.org/modules/dbd\-odbc/trunk <your directory name here>
.Ve
.PP
Which will pull all the files from the subversion trunk to your
specified directory. If you want to see what has changed since the
last release of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 read the Changes file or use \*(L"svn log\*(R" to
get a list of checked in changes.
.SS "Contributing"
.IX Subsection "Contributing"
There are seven main ways you may help with the development and
maintenance of this module:
.IP "Submitting patches" 4
.IX Item "Submitting patches"
Please use Subversion (see above) to get the latest version of
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 from the trunk and submit any patches against that.
.Sp
Please, before submitting a patch:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&   svn update
\&   <try and included a test which demonstrates the fix/change working>
\&   <test your patch>
\&   svn diff > describe_my_diffs.patch
.Ve
.Sp
and send the resulting file to me and cc the dbi\-users@perl.org
mailing list (if you are not a member \- why not!).
.IP "Reporting installs" 4
.IX Item "Reporting installs"
Install CPAN::Reporter and report you installations. This is easy to
do \- see \*(L"\s-1CPAN\s0 Testers Reporting\*(R".
.IP "Report bugs" 4
.IX Item "Report bugs"
If you find what you believe is a bug then enter it into the
<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Name=DBD\-ODBC> system. Where
possible include code which reproduces the problem including any
schema required and the versions of software you are using.
.Sp
If you are unsure whether you have found a bug report it anyway or
post it to the dbi-users mailing list.
.IP "pod comments and corrections" 4
.IX Item "pod comments and corrections"
If you find inaccuracies in the \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 pod or have a comment which
you think should be added then go to <http://annocpan.org> and submit
them there. I get an email for every comment added and will review
each one and apply any changes to the documentation.
.IP "Review \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0" 4
.IX Item "Review DBD::ODBC"
Add your review of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 on <http://cpanratings.perl.org>.
.Sp
If you are a member on ohloh then add your review or register your
use of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 at <http://www.ohloh.net/projects/perl_dbd_odbc>.
.IP "submit test cases" 4
.IX Item "submit test cases"
Most DBDs are built against a single client library for the database.
.Sp
Unlike other DBDs, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 works with many different \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers.
Although they all should be written with regard to the \s-1ODBC\s0
specification drivers have bugs and in some places the specification is
open to interpretation. As a result, when changes are applied to
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 it is very easy to break something in one \s-1ODBC\s0 driver.
.Sp
What helps enormously to identify problems in the many combinations
of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 and \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers is a large test suite. I would greatly
appreciate any test cases and in particular any new test cases for
databases other than \s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server.
.IP "Test \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0" 4
.IX Item "Test DBD::ODBC"
I have a lot of problems deciding when to move a development release
to an official release since I get few test reports for development
releases. What often happens is I call for testers on various lists,
get a few and then get inundated with requests to do an official
release. Then I do an official release and loads of rts appear out of
nowhere and the cycle starts again.
.Sp
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 by its very nature works with many \s-1ODBC\s0 Drivers and it is
impossible for me to have and test them all (this differs from other
DBDs). If you depend on \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 you should be interested in new
releases and if you send me your email address suggesting you are
prepared to be part of the \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 testing network I will credit you
in the Changes file and perhaps the main \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 file.
.SS "\s-1DBI\s0 attribute handling"
.IX Subsection "DBI attribute handling"
If a \s-1DBI\s0 defined attribute is not mentioned here it behaves as per the
\&\s-1DBI\s0 specification.
.PP
\fIReadOnly (boolean)\fR
.IX Subsection "ReadOnly (boolean)"
.PP
\&\s-1DBI\s0 documents the \f(CW\*(C`ReadOnly\*(C'\fR attribute as being settleable and
retrievable on connection and statement handles. In \s-1ODBC\s0 setting
ReadOnly to true causes the connection attribute \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_ACCESS_MODE\*(C'\fR
to be set to \f(CW\*(C`SQL_MODE_READ_ONLY\*(C'\fR and setting it to false will set the
access mode to \f(CW\*(C`SQL_MODE_READ_WRITE\*(C'\fR (which is the default in \s-1ODBC\s0).
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR There is no equivalent of setting ReadOnly on a statement
handle in \s-1ODBC\s0.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR See \s-1ODBC\s0 documentation on \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_ACCESS_MODE\*(C'\fR as setting it
to \f(CW\*(C`SQL_MODE_READ_ONLY\*(C'\fR does \fBnot\fR prevent your script from running
updates or deletes; it is simply a hint to the driver/database that
you won't being doing updates.
.PP
This attribute requires \s-1DBI\s0 version 1.55 or better.
.SS "Private attributes common to connection and statement handles"
.IX Subsection "Private attributes common to connection and statement handles"
\fIodbc_ignore_named_placeholders\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_ignore_named_placeholders"
.PP
Use this if you have special needs (such as Oracle triggers, etc)
where :new or :name mean something special and are not just place
holder names. You \fImust\fR then use ? for binding parameters.  Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& $dbh\->{odbc_ignore_named_placeholders} = 1;
\& $dbh\->do("create trigger foo as if :new.x <> :old.x then ... etc");
.Ve
.PP
Without this, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will think :new and :old are placeholders for
binding and get confused.
.PP
\fIodbc_default_bind_type\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_default_bind_type"
.PP
This value defaults to 0.
.PP
Older versions of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 assumed that the parameter binding type
was 12 (\f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR).  Newer versions always attempt to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR to find the parameter types but if
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR is unavailable \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 falls back to a default
bind type. The internal default bind type is \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR (for
non-unicode build) and \f(CW\*(C`SQL_WVARCHAR\*(C'\fR (for a unicode build). If you
set \f(CW\*(C`odbc_default_bind_type\*(C'\fR to a value other than 0 you override the
internal default.
.PP
\&\fBN.B\fR If you call the \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR method with a \s-1SQL\s0 type this
overrides everything else above.
.PP
\fIodbc_force_bind_type\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_force_bind_type"
.PP
This value defaults to 0.
.PP
If set to anything other than 0 this will force bound parameters to be
bound as this type and \f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR will not be used.
.PP
Older versions of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 assumed the parameter binding type was 12
(\f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR) and newer versions always attempt to call
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR to find the parameter types. If your driver
supports \f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR and it succeeds it may still fail to
describe the parameters accurately (\s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server sometimes does this
with some \s-1SQL\s0 like \fIselect myfunc(?)  where 1 = 1\fR). Setting
\&\f(CW\*(C`odbc_force_bind_type\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR will force \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to bind
all the parameters as \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR and ignore SQLDescribeParam.
.PP
Bare in mind that if you are inserting unicode data you probably want
to use \f(CW\*(C`SQL_WVARCHAR\*(C'\fR and not \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR.
.PP
As this attribute was created to work around buggy \s-1ODBC\s0 Drivers which
support SQLDescribeParam but describe the parameters incorrectly you
are probably better specifying the bind type on the \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR call
on a per statement level rather than blindly setting
\&\f(CW\*(C`odbc_force_bind_type\*(C'\fR across a whole connection.
.PP
\&\fBN.B\fR If you call the \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR method with a \s-1SQL\s0 type this
overrides everything else above.
.PP
\fIodbc_force_rebind\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_force_rebind"
.PP
This is to handle special cases, especially when using multiple result sets.
Set this before execute to \*(L"force\*(R" \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to re-obtain the result set's
number of columns and column types for each execute.  Especially useful for
calling stored procedures which may return different result sets each
execute.  The only performance penalty is during \fIexecute()\fR, but I didn't
want to incur that penalty for all circumstances.  It is probably fairly
rare that this occurs.  This attribute will be automatically set when
multiple result sets are triggered.  Most people shouldn't have to worry
about this.
.PP
\fIodbc_async_exec\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_async_exec"
.PP
Allow asynchronous execution of queries.  This causes a spin-loop
(with a small \*(L"sleep\*(R") until the \s-1ODBC\s0 \s-1API\s0 being called is complete
(i.e., while the \s-1ODBC\s0 \s-1API\s0 returns \f(CW\*(C`SQL_STILL_EXECUTING\*(C'\fR).  This is
useful, however, if you want the error handling and asynchronous
messages (see the \*(L"odbc_err_handler\*(R" and \fIt/20SQLServer.t\fR for an
example of this).
.PP
\fIodbc_query_timeout\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_query_timeout"
.PP
This allows you to change the \s-1ODBC\s0 query timeout (the \s-1ODBC\s0 statement
attribute \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT\*(C'\fR). \s-1ODBC\s0 defines the query time out as
the number of seconds to wait for a \s-1SQL\s0 statement to execute before
returning to the application. A value of 0 (the default) means there
is no time out. Do not confuse this with the \s-1ODBC\s0 attributes
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_LOGIN_TIMEOUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT\*(C'\fR. Add
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  { odbc_query_timeout => 30 }
.Ve
.PP
to your connect, set on the \f(CW\*(C`dbh\*(C'\fR before creating a statement or
explicitly set it on your statement handle. The odbc_query_timeout on
a statement is inherited from the parent connection.
.PP
Note that internally \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 only sets the query timeout if you set it
explicitly and the default of 0 (no time out) is implemented by the
\&\s-1ODBC\s0 driver and not \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0.
.PP
Note that some \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers implement a maximum query timeout value
and will limit timeouts set above their maximum. You may see a
warning if your time out is capped by the driver but there is
currently no way to retrieve the capped value back from the driver.
.PP
Note that some drivers may not support this attribute.
.PP
See \fIt/20SqlServer.t\fR for an example.
.PP
\fIodbc_putdata_start\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_putdata_start"
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`odbc_putdata_start\*(C'\fR defines the size at which \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLPutData\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SQLParamData\*(C'\fR to send larger objects to the
database instead of simply binding them as normal with
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLBindParameter\*(C'\fR. It is mostly a placeholder for future changes
allowing chunks of data to be sent to the database and there is little
reason for anyone to change it currently.
.PP
The default for odbc_putdata_start is 32768 because this value was
hard-coded in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 until 1.16_1.
.PP
\fIodbc_column_display_size\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_column_display_size"
.PP
If you \s-1ODBC\s0 driver does not support the \s-1SQL_COLUMN_DISPLAY_SIZE\s0 and
\&\s-1SQL_COLUMN_LENGTH\s0 attributes to SQLColAtrributes then \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 does
not know how big the column might be. odbc_column_display_size sets
the default value for the column size when retrieving column data
where the size cannot be determined.
.PP
The default for odbc_column_display_size is 2001 because this value was
hard-coded in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 until 1.17_3.
.PP
\fIodbc_utf8_on\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_utf8_on"
.PP
Set this flag to treat all strings returned from the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver
(except columns described as \s-1SQL_BINARY\s0 or \s-1SQL_TIMESTAMP\s0 and its
variations) as \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded.  Some \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers (like Aster and maybe
PostgreSQL) return \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded data but do not support the SQLxxxW
unicode \s-1API\s0. Enabling this flag will cause \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to treat driver
returned data as \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded and it will be marked as such in Perl.
.PP
Do not confuse this with \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0's unicode support. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`odbc_utf8_on\*(C'\fR attribute only applies to non-unicode enabled builds
of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0.
.PP
\fIodbc_old_unicode\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_old_unicode"
.PP
Defaults to off. If set to true returns \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to the old unicode
behavior in 1.29 and earlier. You can also set this on the prepare
method.
.PP
By default \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 now binds all char columns as SQL_WCHARs meaning
the driver is asked to return the bound data as wide (Unicode)
characters encoded in \s-1UCS2\s0. So long as the driver supports the \s-1ODBC\s0
Unicode \s-1API\s0 properly this should mean you get your data back correctly
in Perl even if it is in a character set (codepage) different from the
one you are working in.
.PP
However, if you wrote code using \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 1.29 or earlier and knew
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 bound varchar/longvarchar columns as SQL_CHARs and decoded
them yourself the new behaviour will adversely affect you (sorry). To
revret to the old behaviour set odbc_old_unicode to true.
.PP
You can also set this attribute in the attributes passed to the
prepare method.
.PP
See the stackoverflow question at
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5912082>, the \s-1RT\s0 at
<http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=67994> and lastly a
small discussion on dbi-dev at
<http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.dbi.dev/2011/05/msg6559.html>.
.PP
\fIodbc_describe_parameters\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_describe_parameters"
.PP
Defaults to on. When set this allows \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 to call SQLDescribeParam
(if the driver supports it) to retrieve information about any
parameters.
.PP
When off/false \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will not call SQLDescribeParam and defaults
to binding parameters as \s-1SQL_CHAR/SQL_WCHAR\s0 depending on the build
type.
.PP
You do not have to disable odbc_describe_parameters just because your
driver does not support SQLDescribeParam as \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will work this
out at the start via SQLGetFunctions.
.PP
Note: disabling odbc_describe_parameters when your driver does support
SQLDescribeParam may prevent \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 binding parameters for some
column types properly.
.PP
You can also set this attribute in the attributes passed to the
prepare method.
.PP
This attribute was added so someone moving from freeTDS (a driver
which does not support SQLDescribeParam) to a driver which does
support SQLDescribeParam could do so without changing any Perl. The
situation was very specific since dates were being bound as dates when
SQLDescribeParam was called and chars without and the data format was
not a supported date format.

\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR You might want to look at \s-1DBI\s0's error handler before using
the one in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 however, there are subtle
differences. \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0's odbc_err_handler is called for error \fBand\fR
informational diagnostics i.e., it is called when an \s-1ODBC\s0 call fails
the \s-1SQL_SUCCEEDED\s0 macro which means the \s-1ODBC\s0 call returned \s-1SQL_ERROR\s0
(\-1) or \s-1SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO\s0 (1).
.PP
Allow error and informational diagnostics to be handled by the
application.  A call-back function supplied by the application to
handle or ignore messages.
.PP
The callback function receives four parameters: state (string),
error (string), native error code (number) and the status returned
from the last \s-1ODBC\s0 \s-1API\s0. The fourth argument was added in 1.30_7.
.PP
If the error handler returns 0, the error is ignored, otherwise the
error is passed through the normal \s-1DBI\s0 error handling. Note, if the
status is \s-1SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO\s0 this will \fBnot\fR reach the \s-1DBI\s0 error
handler as it is not an error.
.PP
This can also be used for procedures under \s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server (Sybase too,
probably) to obtain messages from system procedures such as \s-1DBCC\s0.
Check \fIt/20SQLServer.t\fR and \fIt/10handler.t\fR.

\fIodbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE"
.PP
Setting odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE results in a call to SQLSetConnectAttr
to set the \s-1ODBC\s0 \s-1SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\s0 (9) attribute to whatever value you
set odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE to.
.PP
The \s-1ODBC\s0 default for \s-1SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\s0 is 1.
.PP
Usually \s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server does not support multiple active statements
(\s-1MAS\s0) i.e., you cannot have 2 or more outstanding selects.  You can
set odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE to 2 to persuade \s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server to support
multiple active statements.
.PP
Setting \s-1SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\s0 usually only affects calls to SQLExtendedFetch
but does allow \s-1MAS\s0 and as \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 does not use SQLExtendedFetch there
should be no ill effects to \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0.
.PP
Be careful with this attribute as once set to anything larger than 1
(the default) you must retrieve all result-sets before the statement
handle goes out of scope or you can upset the \s-1TDS\s0 protocol and this
can result in a hang. With \s-1DBI\s0 this is unlikely as \s-1DBI\s0 warns when a
statement goes out of scope with outstanding results.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 if you get an error saying \*(L"[Microsoft][\s-1ODBC\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server
Driver]Invalid attribute/option identifier (\s-1SQL\-HY092\s0)\*(R" when you set
odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE in the connect method you need to either a)
upgrade to \s-1DBI\s0 1.616 or above b) set odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE after
connect.
.PP
In versions of \s-1SQL\s0 Server 2005 and later see \*(L"Multiple Active
Statements (\s-1MAS\s0)\*(R" in the \s-1DBD::ODBC::FAQ\s0 instead of using this
attribute.
.PP
Thanks to Andrew Brown for the original patch.
.PP
\&\s-1DBD\s0 developer note: Here lies a bag of worms. Firstly, \s-1SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\s0
is an \s-1ODBC\s0 2 attribute and is usally a statement attribute not a
connection attribute. However, in \s-1ODBC\s0 2.0 you could set statement
attributes on a connection handle and it acted as a default for all
subsequent statement handles created under that connection handle. If
you are using \s-1ODBC\s0 3 the driver manager continues to map this call but
the \s-1ODBC\s0 Driver needs to act on it (the \s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server driver still
appears to but some other \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers for \s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server do not).
Secondly, somewhere a long the line \s-1MS\s0 decided it was no longer valid
to retrieve the \s-1SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\s0 attribute from a connection handle in
an \s-1ODBC\s0 3 application (which \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 now is). In itself, this would
not be a problem except for a minor bug in \s-1DBI\s0 which until release
1.616 mistakenly issued a \s-1FETCH\s0 on any attribute mentioned in the
connect method call. As a result, it you use a \s-1DBI\s0 prior to 1.616 and
attempt to set odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE in the connect method call, \s-1DBI\s0
issues a \s-1FETCH\s0 on odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE and the driver manager throws
it out as an invalid attribute thus resulting in an error. The only
way around this (other than upgrading \s-1DBI\s0) is to set
odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE \s-1AFTER\s0 the call to connect. Thirdly, \s-1MS\s0 withdrew
the \s-1SQLROWSETSIZE\s0 macro from the sql header files in \s-1MDAC\s0 2.7 for 64
bit platforms i.e., \s-1SQLROWSETSIZE\s0 is not defined on 64 bit platforms
from \s-1MDAC\s0 2.7 as it is in a \*(L"#ifdef win32\*(R" (see
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en\-us/library/ms716287%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).
Setting \s-1SQL_ROWSET_SIZE\s0 still seems to take effect on 64 bit platforms
but you can no longer retrieve its value from a connection handle
(hence the issue above with \s-1DBI\s0 redundant \s-1FETCH\s0).

\&\f(CW\*(C`SQLPrepare\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`SQLExecute\*(C'\fR.
.PP
There are drivers that only support \f(CW\*(C`SQLExecDirect\*(C'\fR and the \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0
\&\fIdo()\fR override does not allow returning result sets.  Therefore, the
way to do this now is to set the attribute odbc_exec_direct.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 You may also want to use this option if you are creating
temporary objects (e.g., tables) in \s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server and for some

<http://technet.microsoft.com/en\-US/library/ms131667.aspx> which says
\&\fIPrepared statements cannot be used to create temporary objects on

\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR Even if you build \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 with unicode support you can

\fIodbc_has_unicode\fR
.IX Subsection "odbc_has_unicode"

A read-only attribute signifying whether \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 was built with the
C macro \s-1WITH_UNICODE\s0 or not. A value of 1 indicates \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 was built
with \s-1WITH_UNICODE\s0 else the value returned is 0.
.PP
Building \s-1WITH_UNICODE\s0 affects columns and parameters which are

types \s-1SQL_C_CHAR\s0 or \s-1SQL_C_BINARY\s0 are used and characters read if the
column type is \s-1SQL_C_WCHAR\s0.
.PP
When built with unicode support \f(CW$length\fR specifes the amount of
buffer space to be used when retrieving the lob data but as it is
returned as \s-1SQLWCHAR\s0 characters this means you at most retrieve
\&\f(CW\*(C`$length/2\*(C'\fR characters. When those retrieved characters are encoded
in \s-1UTF\-8\s0 for Perl, the \f(CW$lob\fR scalar may need to be larger than
\&\f(CW$length\fR so \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 grows it appropriately.

.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 to retrieve a lob like this you \fBmust\fR first bind the lob
column specifying BindAsLOB or \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will 1) bind the column as
normal and it will be subject to LongReadLen and b) fail
odbc_lob_read.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Some database engines and \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers do not allow you to
retrieve columns out of order (e.g., \s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0 Server unless you are
using cursors).  In those cases you must ensure the lob retrieved is
the last (or only) column in your select list.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 You can retrieve only part of a lob but you will probably have
to call finish on the statement handle before you do anything else
with that statement.
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 If your select contains multiple lobs you cannot read part of
the first lob, the second lob then return to the first lob. You must

\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 now supports the parse_trace_flag and parse_trace_flags
methods introduced in \s-1DBI\s0 1.42 (see \s-1DBI\s0 for a full description).  As
of \s-1DBI\s0 1.604, the only trace flag defined which is relevant to
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 is '\s-1SQL\s0' which \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 supports by outputting the \s-1SQL\s0
strings (after modification) passed to the prepare and do methods.
.PP
From \s-1DBI\s0 1.617 \s-1DBI\s0 also defines \s-1ENC\s0 (encoding), \s-1CON\s0 (connection) \s-1TXN\s0
(transaction) and \s-1DBD\s0 (\s-1DBD\s0 only) trace flags. \s-1DBI\s0's \s-1ENC\s0 and \s-1CON\s0 trace
flags are synonomous with \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0's odbcunicode and odbcconnection
trace flags though I may remove the \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 ones in the
future. \s-1DBI\s0's \s-1DBD\s0 trace flag allows output of only \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 trace

.PP
Currently \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 supports two private trace flags. The
\&'odbcunicode' flag traces some unicode operations and the
odbcconnection traces the connect process.

To enable tracing of particular flags you use:
.PP
.Vb 2

.PP
If you want to enable a \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 private trace flag before connecting
you need to do something like:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  use DBD::ODBC;

\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 looks for placeholders in the \s-1SQL\s0 string and until 1.24_2 it
did not recognise comments in \s-1SQL\s0 strings so could find what it
believes to be a placeholder in a comment e.g.,
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  select \*(Aq1\*(Aq /* placeholder ? in comment */
\&  select \-\- named placeholder :named in comment
\&    \*(Aq1\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
I cannot be exact about support for ignoring placeholders in literals
but it has existed for a long time in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0. Support for ignoring
placeholders in comments was added in 1.24_2. If you find a case where

.PP
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 implements \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR by calling SQLExecDirect in \s-1ODBC\s0 and not
SQLPrepare followed by SQLExecute so \f(CW\*(C`do\*(C'\fR is not the same as:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
It does this to avoid a round-trip to the server so it is faster.
Normally this is good but some people fall foul of this with \s-1MS\s0 \s-1SQL\s0
Server if they call a procedure which outputs print statements (e.g.,
backup) as the procedure may not complete. See the \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 \s-1FAQ\s0 and
in general you are better to use prepare/execute when calling
procedures.
.PP
In addition, you should realise that since \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 does not create a

passed in when a do fails will be the database handle and not
a statement handle.

string not beginning with a number). \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 supports all these methods
for naming placeholders but you must only use one method throughout
a particular \s-1SQL\s0 string. If you mix placeholder methods you will get

Although the \s-1DBI\s0 documentation (as of 1.604) does not say how named

.PP
.Vb 2
\&  prepare("insert into mytable values (:fred)");
\&  bind_param(":foo", 1);
.Ve

SQLDisconnect returns state 25000 (transaction in progress).
.SS "Unicode"
.IX Subsection "Unicode"
The \s-1ODBC\s0 specification supports wide character versions (a postfix of
\&'W') of some of the normal \s-1ODBC\s0 APIs e.g., SQLDriverConnectW is a wide
character version of SQLDriverConnect.
.PP
In \s-1ODBC\s0 on Windows the wide characters are defined as SQLWCHARs (2
bytes) and are \s-1UCS\-2\s0. On non-Windows, the main driver managers I know
of have implemented the wide character APIs differently:
.IP "unixODBC" 4
.IX Item "unixODBC"
unixODBC mimics the Windows \s-1ODBC\s0 \s-1API\s0 precisely meaning the wide
character versions expect and return 2\-byte characters in
\&\s-1UCS\-2\s0.
.Sp
unixODBC will happily recognise \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers which only have the \s-1ANSI\s0
versions of the \s-1ODBC\s0 \s-1API\s0 and those that have the wide versions
too.
.Sp
unixODBC will allow an \s-1ANSI\s0 application to work with a unicode
\&\s-1ODBC\s0 driver and vice versa (although in the latter case you obviously
cannot actually use unicode).
.Sp
unixODBC does not prevent you sending \s-1UTF\-8\s0 in the \s-1ANSI\s0 versions of
the \s-1ODBC\s0 APIs but whether that is understood by your \s-1ODBC\s0 driver is
another matter.
.Sp
unixODBC differs in only one way from the Microsoft \s-1ODBC\s0 driver in
terms of unicode support in that it avoids unnecessary translations
between single byte and double byte characters when an \s-1ANSI\s0
application is using a unicode-aware \s-1ODBC\s0 driver by requiring unicode
applications to signal their intent by calling SQLDriverConnectW
first. On Windows, the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver manager always uses the wide
versions of the \s-1ODBC\s0 \s-1API\s0 in \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers which provide the wide
versions regardless of what the application really needs and this
results in a lot of unnecessary character translations when you have
an \s-1ANSI\s0 application and a unicode \s-1ODBC\s0 driver.

.IP "bound columns (introduced in 1.15)" 4
.IX Item "bound columns (introduced in 1.15)"
If the \s-1DBMS\s0 reports the column as being a wide character (SQL_Wxxx) it

.IP "bound parameters" 4
.IX Item "bound parameters"
If the perl scalars you bind to parameters are marked \s-1UTF8\s0 and the
\&\s-1DBMS\s0 reports the type as being a wide type or you bind the parameter
as a wide type they will be converted to wide characters and bound as
such.
.PP
Since version 1.16_4, the default parameter bind type is \s-1SQL_WVARCHAR\s0
for unicode builds of \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0. This only affects \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers which
do not support SQLDescribeParam and only then if you do not
specifically set a sql type on the bind_param method call.

\fIUnicode \- Caveats\fR
.IX Subsection "Unicode - Caveats"
.PP
For Unicode support on any platform in Perl you will need at least
Perl 5.8.1 \- sorry but this is the way it is with Perl.
.PP
The Unicode support in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 expects a \s-1WCHAR\s0 to be 2 bytes (as it
is on Windows and as the \s-1ODBC\s0 specification suggests it is). Until
\&\s-1ODBC\s0 specifies any other Unicode support it is not envisioned this
will change.  On \s-1UNIX\s0 there are a few different \s-1ODBC\s0 driver
managers. I have only tested the unixODBC driver manager
(http://www.unixodbc.org) with Unicode support and it was built with
defaults which set \s-1WCHAR\s0 as 2 bytes.
.PP
I believe that the iODBC driver manager expects wide characters to be
wchar_t types (which are usually 4) and hence \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will not work
iODBC when built for unicode.
.PP
The \s-1ODBC\s0 Driver must expect Unicode data specified in SQLBindParameter
and SQLBindCol to be \s-1UTF16\s0 in local endianness. Similarly, in calls to
SQLPrepareW, SQLDescribeColW and SQLDriverConnectW.
.PP
You should be aware that once Unicode support is enabled it affects a
number of \s-1DBI\s0 methods (some of which you might not expect). For
instance, when listing tables, columns etc some drivers
(e.g. Microsoft \s-1SQL\s0 Server) will report the column types as wide types
even if the strings actually fit in 7\-bit \s-1ASCII\s0. As a result, there is
an overhead for retrieving this column data as 2 bytes per character
will be transmitted (compared with 1 when Unicode support is not
enabled) and these strings will be converted into \s-1UTF8\s0 but will end up
fitting (in most cases) into 7bit \s-1ASCII\s0 so a lot of conversion work
has been performed for nothing. If you don't have Unicode table and
column names or Unicode column data in your tables you are best
disabling Unicode support.
.PP
I am at present unsure if ChopBlanks processing on Unicode strings is
working correctly on \s-1UNIX\s0. If nothing else the construct L' ' in
dbdimp.c might not work with all \s-1UNIX\s0 compilers. Reports of issues and
patches welcome.

\&\s-1SQL_WCHAR\s0 \s-1ODBC\s0 type to support unicode in Perl.
.PP
Wide characters returned from the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver will be converted to
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 and the perl scalars will have the utf8 flag set (by using
sv_utf8_decode).
.PP
perl scalars which are \s-1UTF\-8\s0 and are sent through the \s-1ODBC\s0 \s-1API\s0 will be
converted to \s-1UTF\-16\s0 and passed to the \s-1ODBC\s0 wide APIs or signalled as
SQL_WCHARs (e.g., in the case of bound columns).
.PP
When built for unicode, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 will always call SQLDriverConnectW
(and not SQLDriverConnect) even if a) your connection string is not
unicode b) you have not got a \s-1DBI\s0 later than 1.607, because unixODBC
requires SQLDriverConnectW to be called if you want to call other
unicode \s-1ODBC\s0 APIs later. As a result, if you build for unicode and
pass \s-1ASCII\s0 strings to the connect method they will be converted to
\&\s-1UTF\-16\s0 and passed to SQLDriverConnectW. This should make no real
difference to perl not using unicode connection strings.
.PP
You will need a \s-1DBI\s0 later than 1.607 to support unicode connection
strings because until post 1.607 there was no way for \s-1DBI\s0 to pass

Microsoft Access, FreeTDS).
.PP
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 uses the \f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR \s-1API\s0 when parameters are bound
to your \s-1SQL\s0 to find the types of the parameters. If the \s-1ODBC\s0 driver
does not support \f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR, \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 assumes the parameters
are \f(CW\*(C`SQL_VARCHAR\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`SQL_WVARCHAR\*(C'\fR types (depending on whether
\&\s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 is built for unicode or not). In any case, if you bind a
parameter and specify a \s-1SQL\s0 type this overrides any type \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0
would choose.
.PP
For \s-1ODBC\s0 drivers which do not support \f(CW\*(C`SQLDescribeParam\*(C'\fR the default
behavior in \s-1DBD::ODBC\s0 may not be what you want. To change the default
parameter bind type set \*(L"odbc_default_bind_type\*(R". If, after that you
have some \s-1SQL\s0 where you need to vary the parameter types used add the
\&\s-1SQL\s0 type to the end of the \f(CW\*(C`bind_param\*(C'\fR method.

.SS "\s-1CPAN\s0 Testers Reporting"
.IX Subsection "CPAN Testers Reporting"
Please, please, please (is that enough), consider installing
CPAN::Reporter so that when you install perl modules a report of the
installation success or failure can be sent to cpan testers. In this
way module authors 1) get feedback on the fact that a module is being
installed 2) get to know if there are any installation problems. Also
other people like you may look at the test reports to see how
successful they are before choosing the version of a module to
install.
.PP
See this guide on how to get started with sending test reports:
