Net::Telnet \- interact with TELNET port or other TCP ports
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`use Net::Telnet ();\*(C'\fR
.PP
see \s-1METHODS\s0 section below
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a \s-1TCP\s0 port and do
network I/O, especially to a port using the \s-1TELNET\s0 protocol.  Simple
I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are provided.  More
sophisticated interactive features are provided because connecting to
a \s-1TELNET\s0 port ultimately means communicating with a program designed
for human interaction.  These interactive features include the ability
to specify a time-out and to wait for patterns to appear in the input
stream, such as the prompt from a shell.
.PP
Other reasons to use this module than strictly with a \s-1TELNET\s0 port are:
.IP "\(bu" 2
You're not familiar with sockets and you want a simple way to make
client connections to \s-1TCP\s0 services.
.IP "\(bu" 2
You want to be able to specify your own time-out while connecting,
reading, or writing.
.IP "\(bu" 2
You're communicating with an interactive program at the other end of
some socket or pipe and you want to wait for certain patterns to
appear.
.PP
Here's an example that prints who's logged-on to the remote host
sparky.  In addition to a username and password, you must also know
the user's shell prompt, which for this example is \f(CW\*(C`bash$\*(C'\fR
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    use Net::Telnet ();
\&    $t = new Net::Telnet (Timeout => 10,
\&                          Prompt => \*(Aq/bash\e$ $/\*(Aq);
\&    $t\->open("sparky");
\&    $t\->login($username, $passwd);
\&    @lines = $t\->cmd("who");

.SS "What To Know Before Using"
.IX Subsection "What To Know Before Using"
.IP "\(bu" 2
All output is flushed while all input is buffered.  Each object
contains its own input buffer.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The output record separator for \f(CW\*(C`print()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`cmd()\*(C'\fR is set to
\&\f(CW"\en"\fR by default, so that you don't have to append all your commands
with a newline.  To avoid printing a trailing \f(CW"\en"\fR use \f(CW\*(C`put()\*(C'\fR or
set the \fIoutput_record_separator\fR to \f(CW""\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The methods \f(CW\*(C`login()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`cmd()\*(C'\fR use the \fIprompt\fR setting in the
object to determine when a login or remote command is complete.  Those
methods will fail with a time-out if you don't set the prompt
correctly.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Use a combination of \f(CW\*(C`print()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`waitfor()\*(C'\fR as an alternative to
\&\f(CW\*(C`login()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`cmd()\*(C'\fR when they don't do what you want.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Errors such as timing-out are handled according to the error mode
action.  The default action is to print an error message to standard
error and have the program die.  See the \f(CW\*(C`errmode()\*(C'\fR method for more
information.
.IP "\(bu" 2
When constructing the match operator argument for \f(CW\*(C`prompt()\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`waitfor()\*(C'\fR, always use single quotes instead of double quotes to
avoid unexpected backslash interpretation (e.g. \f(CW\*(Aq/bash\e$ $/\*(Aq\fR).  If
you're constructing a \s-1DOS\s0 like file path, you'll need to use four
backslashes to represent one (e.g. \f(CW\*(Aq/c:\e\e\e\eusers\e\e\e\ebill>$/i\*(Aq\fR).
.Sp
Of course don't forget about regexp metacharacters like \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR.  You'll only need a single backslash to quote them.  The anchor
metacharacters \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR refer to positions in the input buffer.
To avoid matching characters read that look like a prompt, it's a good
idea to end your prompt pattern with the \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR anchor.  That way the
prompt will only match if it's the last thing read.
.IP "\(bu" 2
In the input stream, each sequence of \fIcarriage return\fR and \fIline
feed\fR (i.e. \f(CW"\e015\e012"\fR or \s-1CR\s0 \s-1LF\s0) is converted to \f(CW"\en"\fR.  In the
output stream, each occurrence of \f(CW"\en"\fR is converted to a sequence
of \s-1CR\s0 \s-1LF\s0.  See \f(CW\*(C`binmode()\*(C'\fR to change the behavior.  \s-1TCP\s0 protocols
typically use the \s-1ASCII\s0 sequence, carriage return and line feed to
designate a newline.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Timing-out while making a connection is disabled for machines that
don't support the \f(CW\*(C`alarm()\*(C'\fR function.  Most notably these include
MS-Windows machines.
.IP "\(bu" 2
You'll need to be running at least Perl version 5.002 to use this
module.  This module does not require any libraries that don't already
come with a standard Perl distribution.
.Sp
If you have the \s-1IO::\s0 libraries installed (they come standard with
perl5.004 and later) then IO::Socket::INET is used as a base class,
otherwise FileHandle is used.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Contact me, Jay Rogers <jay@rgrs.com>, if you find any bugs or have
suggestions for improvement.
.SS "Debugging"
.IX Subsection "Debugging"
The typical usage bug causes a time-out error because you've made
incorrect assumptions about what the remote side actually sends.  The
easiest way to reconcile what the remote side sends with your
expectations is to use \f(CW\*(C`input_log()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`dump_log()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`dump_log()\*(C'\fR allows you to see the data being sent from the remote
side before any translation is done, while \f(CW\*(C`input_log()\*(C'\fR shows you
the results after translation.  The translation includes converting
end of line characters, removing and responding to \s-1TELNET\s0 protocol
commands in the data stream.
.SS "Style of Named Parameters"
.IX Subsection "Style of Named Parameters"
Two different styles of named parameters are supported.  This document
only shows the \s-1IO::\s0 style:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Net::Telnet\->new(Timeout => 20);
.Ve
.PP
however the dash-option style is also allowed:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    Net::Telnet\->new(\-timeout => 20);
.Ve
.SS "Connecting to a Remote MS-Windows Machine"
.IX Subsection "Connecting to a Remote MS-Windows Machine"
By default MS-Windows doesn't come with a \s-1TELNET\s0 server.  However
third party \s-1TELNET\s0 servers are available.  Unfortunately many of these
servers falsely claim to be a \s-1TELNET\s0 server.  This is especially true
of the so-called \*(L"Microsoft Telnet Server\*(R" that comes installed with
some newer versions MS-Windows.
.PP
When a \s-1TELNET\s0 server first accepts a connection, it must use the \s-1ASCII\s0
control characters carriage-return and line-feed to start a new line
(see \s-1RFC854\s0).  A server like the \*(L"Microsoft Telnet Server\*(R" that
doesn't do this, isn't a \s-1TELNET\s0 server.  These servers send \s-1ANSI\s0
terminal escape sequences to position to a column on a subsequent line
and to even position while writing characters that are adjacent to
each other.  Worse, when sending output these servers resend
previously sent command output in a misguided attempt to display an
entire terminal screen.
.PP
Connecting Net::Telnet to one of these false \s-1TELNET\s0 servers makes your
job of parsing command output very difficult.  It's better to replace
a false \s-1TELNET\s0 server with a real \s-1TELNET\s0 server.  The better \s-1TELNET\s0
servers for MS-Windows allow you to avoid the \s-1ANSI\s0 escapes by turning
off something some of them call \fIconsole mode\fR.

This method sends the command \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR, and reads the characters
sent back by the command up until and including the matching prompt.
It's assumed that the program to which you're sending is some kind of
command prompting interpreter such as a shell.
.Sp
The command \fI\f(CI$string\fI\fR is automatically appended with the
output_record_separator, By default that's \f(CW"\en"\fR.  This is similar
to someone typing a command and hitting the return key.  Set the
output_record_separator to change this behavior.
.Sp
In a scalar context, the characters read from the remote side are
discarded and \f(CW1\fR is returned on success.  On time-out, eof, or other
failures, the error mode action is performed.  See \f(CW\*(C`errmode()\*(C'\fR.

In a list context, just the output generated by the command is
returned, one line per element.  In other words, all the characters in
between the echoed back command string and the prompt are returned.
If the command happens to return no output, a list containing one
element, the empty string is returned.  This is so the list will
indicate true in a boolean context.  On time-out, eof, or other
failures, the error mode action is performed.  See \f(CW\*(C`errmode()\*(C'\fR.

Many command interpreters echo back the command sent.  In most
situations, this method removes the first line returned from the
remote side (i.e. the echoed back command).  See \f(CW\*(C`cmd_remove_mode()\*(C'\fR

.Sp
The \fIOutput\fR named parameter provides an alternative method of
receiving command output.  If you pass a scalar reference, all the
output (even if it contains multiple lines) is returned in the
referenced scalar.  If you pass an array or hash reference, the lines
of output are returned in the referenced array or hash.  You can use

This method controls how to deal with echoed back commands in the

By default, \fI\f(CI$mode\fI\fR is set to \f(CW"auto"\fR.  Auto means that whether or

.Sp
By default, the \f(CW\*(C`output_record_separator()\*(C'\fR is set to \f(CW"\en"\fR so all
your commands automatically end with a newline.  In most cases your
output is being read by a command interpreter which won't accept a

Here's an example that uses the ssh program to connect to a remote
host.  Because the ssh program reads and writes to its controlling
terminal, the IO::Pty module is used to create a new pseudo terminal
for use by ssh.  A new Net::Telnet object is then created to read and
write to that pseudo terminal.  To use the code below, substitute
\&\*(L"changeme\*(R" with the actual host, user, password, and command prompt.

Here's an example that changes a user's login password.  Because the
passwd program always prompts for passwords on its controlling
terminal, the IO::Pty module is used to create a new pseudo terminal
for use by passwd.  A new Net::Telnet object is then created to read
and write to that pseudo terminal.  To use the code below, substitute
\&\*(L"changeme\*(R" with the actual old and new passwords.

Here's an example you can use to down load a file of any type.  The
file is read from the remote host's standard output using cat.  To
prevent any output processing, the remote host's standard output is
put in raw mode using the Bourne shell.  The Bourne shell is used
because some shells, notably tcsh, prevent changing tty modes.  Upon
completion, \s-1FTP\s0 style statistics are printed to stderr.
