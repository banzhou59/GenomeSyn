This is related to Oracle \s-1RDBMS\s0 9.2 and later, since Oracle 
made fundamental changes to oracle installation requirements 
and factual installation with this release.
.PP
Oracle's goal was to make \s-1VMS\s0 installation be more like on
*nix and Windows, with an all new Oracle Home structure too,
requiring an \s-1ODS\-5\s0 disk to install Oracle Home on instead of
the good old \s-1ODS\-2\s0.
.PP
Another major change is the introduction of an Oracle generated
logical name table for oracle logical names like \s-1ORA_ROOT\s0 and all
its derivatives like \s-1ORA_PROGINT\s0 etc. And that this logical name
table is inserted in \s-1LNM$FILE_DEV\s0 in \s-1LNM$PROCESS_DIRECTORY\s0.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    (LNM$PROCESS_DIRECTORY)
\&
\&    "LNM$FILE_DEV" = "SERVER_810111112"
\&            = "LNM$PROCESS"
\&            = "LNM$JOB"
\&            = "LNM$GROUP"
\&            = "LNM$SYSTEM"
\&            = "DECW$LOGICAL_NAMES"
.Ve
.PP
This ensures that any process that needs to have access to 
oracle gets the environment by just adding one logical name table
to a central process specific mechanism.
.PP
But as it is inserted at the very top of \s-1LNM$FILE_DEV\s0 it also
represents a source of misfortune \- especially if a user with
enough privilege to update the oracle table does so (presumably
unintentionally), as an examble by changing \s-1NLS_LANG\s0.
.PP
\&\s-1PERL\s0 has the abillity to define, redefine and undefine (deassign)
logical names, but if not told otherwise by the user does it
in the first table in above list, and not as one would normally
expect in the process table.
.PP
Installing \s-1DBI\s0 and DBD::Oracle has influence upon this since in
both cases a few environment variables are read or set in the
test phase.
For \s-1DBI\s0 it is the logical \s-1SYS$SCRATCH\s0, which is a \s-1JOB\s0 logical.
For DBD-Oracle it is when testing a new feature in the Oracle 
\&\s-1RDBMS:\s0 \s-1UTF8\s0 and \s-1UTF16\s0 character set functionality, and in order 
to do this it sets and unsets the related environment variables 
\&\s-1NLS_NCHAR\s0 and \s-1NLS_LANG\s0.
.PP
If one is not careful this changes the values set in the oracle 
table \- and in the worst case stays active until the next major 
system reset. It can also be a very hard error to track down 
since it happens in a place where one normally never looks.
.PP
Furthermore, it is very possibly that some or all of the \s-1UTF\s0 tests
fails, since if one have a variable like \s-1NLS_LANG\s0 in his process
table, then even though 'mms test' sets it in the wrong table
it is not invoked as it is overruled by the process logical...
.PP
The way to ensure that no logicals are set in the oracle table and
that the \s-1UTF\s0 tests get the best environment to test in, and that 
\&\s-1DBI\s0 correctly translates the \s-1SYS$SCRATCH\s0 logical, use the
logical
.PP
.Vb 1
\&      PERL_ENV_TABLES
.Ve
.PP
to ensure that \s-1PERL\s0's behavior is to leave the oracle table alone and
use the process table instead:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&      $ DEFINE PERL_ENV_TABLES LNM$PROCESS, LNM$JOB
.Ve
.PP
This tells \s-1PERL\s0 to use the \s-1LNM$PROCESS\s0 table as the default place to
set and unset variables so that only the perl users environment
is affected when installing DBD::Oracle, and ensures that the
\&\s-1LNM$JOB\s0 table is read when \s-1SYS$SCRATCH\s0 is to be translated.
.PP
\&\s-1PERL_ENV_TABLES\s0 is well documented in the \s-1PERLVMS\s0 man page.
.PP
Oracle8 releases are not affected, as they don't have the 
oracle table implementation, and no \s-1UTF\s0 support.
.PP
Oracle 9.0 is uncertain, since testing has not been possible yet,
but the remedy will not hurt :)
